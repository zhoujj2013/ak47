Notes on miRanda-3.3a code (aug2010)

- generation of postscript diagram file during energy folding was
inhibited

- un-necessary files pruned from distribution, including over 20 files
from RNAlib.

- autoconf/automake configuration refreshed using recent version of
autoconf

- new code module added: "ExpString", an expanding string object. This
was added to allow sequences of arbitrary length to be imported from
input files efficiently. As strings are read from input files, the
memory object allocates new space as needed to hold the complete
sequence. Hard limits on sequence length are avoided. This also helps
avoid overflow in the construction of the list of matched positions in
scan.c. There is no more compiled limit on sequence length or
sequence identifier length. (#define SEQUENCE_LENGTH 100000)

- the scmatrix of scores of base pairings was unified, since matricies
were identical and redundant. Now Matches, Mismatches, Wobbles, and
Undefined base alignments are scalar values in swat.c and scoring
matricies are constructed from them. (see initialize_scores())

- code for doing extreme value statistics, shuffling, and reporting
z-scores. Note: two fields (z-score and p-value) were dropped from the
miRanda output of hit records.

- email addresses in headers updated

- drop inline specifiers in RNAlib/fold.c to reduce compiling issues
under some OS's.

- examples directory sequences were corrected and updated

- man page updated to reflect current command line options and
defaults

- reduced usage of global variables, modularized construction /
destruction. pruned unused variables and functions. varible names
improved where helpful.

- when reading sequences, nucleotides are now checked for valid fasta
character codes and format. Un-recognized characters cause format
errors. Indeterminate nucleotide base codes [NRYKMSWBDHVX] are all
equivalent in the internal representation. Additional checks added to
ensure proper FASTA file formatted sequences, including blank line
toleration.

- defaults for command-line arguments changed. -sc 140, -go -9,
-ge -4, -en 1.0 (note: positive energy threshold means *no* energy
filtering) Validity checks added on command line arguments.

- utr truncation and microRNA/UTR pair specification file
functionality corrected and tested.

- dropped non-functional "REVERSE" sense target site reporting. All
target predictions are "FORWARD".

- struct final_score type was used for only a single member,
positional, a fixed length character string. This was converted to an
ExpString and moved out of the struct, which was dropped.

- function prototypes consolidated into miranda.h, and reduced to
those with external callers. Also organized by location.

- corrected "off by one" error in list of predicted target site
offsets in final summary of all hits between a microRNA and a UTR.
(In the ">>" lines in miRanda output)

- test_for_overlap() function now requires an overlap in the seed
region (rather than anywhere in the alignment) in order to suppress
alternate traceback paths for the same microRNA aligned in the same
position of the reference sequence. Also, sort order made
deterministic by adding secondary key: reference end position.

- gaps adjacent to the seed position were not previously handled
properly for the "-strict" command line option. This version now
never allows unpaired bases (bulges) of the microRNA in offset 2-8.
Additionally, unpaired bases in the reference utr sequence which fall
adjacent to the seed now do not cause rejection under the "-strict"
command line argument.

- alignment traces which begin at offset 1 with an unaligned base will
never be better than the same alignment which excludes that base from
the aligned region (assuming negative gap scores). These are prevented
from being output (which was possible due to overlap filtering).

- printhit_kshv() and printhit() unified. An argument determines if
hits are reported with full formatting or as key-value list. (supports
"-keyval" command line option)

Notes on miRanda-3.2a code (sept2008)

- alignment threshold (-sc) now indicates the minimal passing alignment score, rather thant he maximal failing score.

- microRNA (length = n) offset positions 1, n-1, and n are now always scored with zero contribution to the alignment score

=============================================================================
Notes on miRanda-3.1a code (jan2008)

- offsets for alignments are given as offsets relative to the 5' end of either the microRNA or the UTR.

- scoring of g:u wobbles set to "1". Inside seed, it is scaled by the seed scaling factor

- A:U matches and G:C matches are both scored equally as "5"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on miRanda-3.0 code

- The seed region match when running miRanda in strict mode were extended to 2-8.
Also, changes were made to the scan.c that checks for seed matches.

- Reported hits output the position of the target site on the miRNA (query) and mRNA(ref). The coordinates for
miRNA are in reference to the 3' end. For example:

  Forward:     Score: 176.000000  Q:3 to 22  R:4502 to 4530 Align Len (27) (70.37%) (74.07%)

   Query:    3' ucUCGAUGUC--ACG-----AAGUAGAGU 5'
                  ||:|||||  |||     |||||||||
   Ref:      5' taAGTTACAGTTTGCACAAGTTCATCTCA 3'

   Energy:  -23.830000 kCal/Mol

Scores for this hit:
>hsa-miR-143__c gi|34485724|ref|NM_033360.2|    176.00  -23.83  0.00    0.000000e+00    3 23    4502 4530       27      70.37%  74.07%

Note that "Q:3 to 22" means that the alignment actually end 3 nt from the miRNA 3'end.
This should be "Q:1 to 20" - correct either in miRanda code or in parsing. 

- Results from (Genes&Dev, 2004:504-511) and (Nature Biotech, 2005,23,1440) suggests G:U wobbles
 in seed regions interferes with miRNA activity. In accordance, the match5p matrix was modified such that 
 G:U pairs are scored as mismatches.
 
- Changed G:U wobble weights in match matrix (scmatrix.h) from 2 to 0. Reduce the influance of G:U wobble on the alignments 

- miRanda does not report back a single max alignment but all alignments that pass the score threshold value.

- Changed match weights of A:U to 4 and kept G:C as 5. 

- Ran miranda mouse predictions with the following flags "-go -4.0 -ge -9.0 -en -16.0 -strict"

- The reported percent identity and percent similarity are related to the aligned region and not the entire length of the seq
 From example:
   Forward:     Score: 154.000000  Q:2 to 13  R:1 to 13 Align Len (11) (90.91%) (100.00%)
